Welcome to the AGV_fuzzy project! 

This repository contains my work on **Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV)** using **fuzzy logic**. If you're interested in learning more about the details of this project, feel free to check out the **PDF document** included in this repository for a deeper dive into the methodology and results.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the project further, don't hesitate to reach out. Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts and ideas!
